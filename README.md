# HydroThermalOptimization

This project implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve a hydrothermal coordination problem. The objective is to minimize the costs of thermal generation while respecting the system's constraints, including reservoir capacity, turbine limits, and energy load requirements.

## Problem Overview

The system consists of:
1. **Hydropower Generation**: Based on inflows to the reservoir and available turbine capacity.
2. **Thermal Power Generation**: Supplemental thermal generation to meet load requirements after considering the hydropower output.

The objective is to minimize the total cost of thermal generation over a 6-hour period, considering the dynamics of the hydroelectric system and thermal generation constraints.
